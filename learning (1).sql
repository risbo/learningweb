(16, 'By John Russell\nImagine a beach; a quiet place, with only the noise of the sea and the gulls in the background. There are boats floating near the shore and a few people swimming in the water next to them. It?s a hot day, and there are some people lying on the sand enjoying the sunshine and slowly going brown. There are no shops, no people making noises, no loud music, everything is peaceful. There is just the sea, the sun, and the beach; a little paradise.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe beach is on the south coast of Scotland, near a little town called Gatehouse of Fleet in the county of Dumfries and Galloway. 22 years ago my family and I found this place for the first time and we have never really left it. Every year in the summer while other people go on holiday to foreign countries and exotic places, we go to our private paradise and relax. There is a little campsite with tents and caravans next to the beach, and this becomes our home for one month every year.\n\nGrowing up\n\nFor a child a beach is a wonderful place. Here I found lots of space to run and play on the sand or to swim in the water. Being a campsite there were always lots of other families with children to play with. Another of my favourite activities was climbing on the rocks and cliffs around the beach. Rock pools were very educational places where I used to study the little fish and sea animals. Silence was also important; at school I was always surrounded by people and noise but the beach gave me the chance to be on my own and think, or read, away from anyone else.\n\nStorms\n\nAlthough the sea can be beautiful, this beach is sometimes a dangerous place to be. When the weather is bad there are often storms with strong winds. When this happens the waves can get up to 2-3 metres high ? definitely not weather for swimming. Every year some of the boats anchored on the beach are lost because the sea is so rough. I remember holding down our tent to stop the wind blowing it away on many occasions! However, if the waves weren?t too high all the children (and some adults) used to go swimming in life jackets, as it was very exciting.\n\nAn interesting hobby\n\nSailing is a very serious activity in the UK, and this beach is no different. There are large racing boats for three or more people, smaller boats (such as the Topper) for just one or two people, fishing boats and windsurfers. In fact people on this beach are willing to try any type of water-sport; water skiing, speed boating, even the recent sport of sail surfing is becoming popular. Over the years my family has had 4 different boats, from a small Topper to a large Caprice for racing. We have sailed, raced, and fished off the boats, and have even capsized in bad weather a few times.\n\nSurroundings\n\nIf this beach had been next to a town or near a popular tourist area I don?t think we would have continued going there. But its location is very beautiful indeed. It?s in the middle of green countryside with many different types of plants and flowers, and in the background the hills of Galloway can be seen. Lots of photographers and artists come to the area (also known as the Solway) because they can capture such beautiful scenery.\n\nA refuge\n\nEven after 22 years, the beach is still a sanctuary for me. It?s a place away from the rest of the world where I can forget about life?s problems, and just relax. In today?s modern, busy world, everyone should have a place like this.', '2017-08-08'),

(19, 'North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers\' School set the boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes, under one of which I found the late tenant\'s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.When the short days of winter came, dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses, where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street, light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner, we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan\'s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea, we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan\'s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed, and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body, and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs\' cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O\'Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.', '2017-08-09'),

(46, 'Object Oriented Programming, \nJava is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented. The advantages of object oriented software development are shown below:\nModular development of code, which leads to easy maintenance and modification.\nReusability of code.\nImproved reliability and flexibility of code.\nIncreased understanding of code.\nObject-oriented programming contains many significant features, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. We analyze each feature separately in the following sections.\n\nEncapsulation\n\nEncapsulation provides objects with the ability to hide their internal characteristics and behavior. Each object provides a number of methods, which can be accessed by other objects and change its internal data. In Java, there are three access modifiers: public, private and protected. Each modifier imposes different access rights to other classes, either in the same or in external packages. Some of the advantages of using encapsulation are listed below:\nThe internal state of every objected is protected by hiding its attributes.\nIt increases usability and maintenance of code, because the behavior of an object can be independently changed or extended.\nIt improves modularity by preventing objects to interact with each other, in an undesired way.\nYou can refer to our tutorial here for more details and examples on encapsulation.\n\nPolymorphism\n\nPolymorphism is the ability of programming languages to present the same interface for differing underlying data types. A polymorphic type is a type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type.\nInheritance\n\nInheritance provides an object with the ability to acquire the fields and methods of another class, called base class. Inheritance provides re-usability of code and can be used to add additional features to an existing class, without modifying it.\nAbstraction\n\nAbstraction is the process of separating ideas from specific instances and thus, develop classes in terms of their own functionality, instead of their implementation details. Java supports the creation and existence of abstract classes that expose interfaces, without including the actual implementation of all methods. The abstraction technique aims to separate the implementation details of a class from its behavior.\n\nDifferences between Abstraction and Encapsulation\n\nAbstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts. On the one hand, abstraction focuses on the behavior of an object. On the other hand, encapsulation focuses on the implementation of an object?s behavior. Encapsulation is usually achieved by hiding information about the internal state of an object and thus, can be seen as a strategy used in order to provide abstraction.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class ? Java provides and supports the creation both of abstract classes and interfaces. Both implementations share some common characteristics, but they differ in the following features:\nAll methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.\nA class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.\nIn order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.\nAbstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.\nVariables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.\nMembers of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public.\nAn interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. An abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if it contains a main method.', '2017-08-06'),

(81, 'Hi, and welcome to the Coursera specialization on Software Design and Architecture. I\'m Ken Wong. It\'s my goal to help you become an experienced software architect who thinks critically about the design and architecture of your products in order to create great software. I\'ll be doing this with the help of our learning navigator, Sam Jeffery. You\'ll meet her in a moment. You\'ve probably already worked on some software projects in the past. You may have worked on small programs, so you may worked on a larger scale system. Take a minute and think of the projects that you worked on. Did they have a good design? Could the design be done better? Was there even a design at all? How do you know if the software was well-designed? Think of how easy it was to make changes to your code. Did a small code change produce a ripple-effect for changes elsewhere in the code? Was your code hard to reuse? Was the software difficult to maintain after a release? If you answered yes to any of these questions, chances are you could benefit from a better design. Good design isn\'t just about code. It is about being able to express ideas for your software with other developers, other teams, and your clients. Having a well-thought design makes your software easier to implement, reduces a need for major changes later or the project and it saves you from headaches down the line. Whether you\'re a new developer looking to expand your knowledge or an experienced industry veteran, knowledge of Software Design Architecture will help your software become flexible, reusable, and maintainable. Hi, and welcome to the Coursera specialization on Software Design and Architecture. I\'m Sam Jeffery, your learning navigator through this specialization. It\'s my goal to help you become an experienced software architect who thinks critically about the design and architecture of your products in order to create great software. So, what is software design and architecture? How does it improve your software products? Consider this scenario. You join a project that\'s been in development for a while. You look at the code and become instantly overwhelmed. You can\'t tell what the purpose of the pieces are, things are unorganized, and design documentation is non-existent. You don\'t even know where to begin. These are all signs that the project was not well-designed from the outset. Or let\'s say that you are now working on a personal development project. When you began, you weren\'t quite sure what the functionalities would be, but you just started coding. It didn\'t matter that the code was unorganized because you were the only one working on it and you know how it works. You come up with a great new feature for your product, but in implementing it, you broke the program elsewhere. You should have designed it right. I\'m guessing that you have experienced scenarios like these. They are quite common in the software industry, which shows you why software design and architecture is so beneficial. In this specialization, you will learn how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems. You will learn how to express in document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation. We will give you lots of practical examples and opportunities for you to apply this knowledge that you leave this specialization with employable skills and relevant knowledge to confidently work in the software industry. It\'s important to note that this specialization primarily covers software design and not user-interface design. Although the two aspects of design are closely related, we will mostly focus on software design. We have tried to align our course with the ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Curriculum Guidelines. It recommends the topics when teaching software design and architecture. However, with that being said, this specialization has no affiliation with ACM or IEEE. I provided a reference to these guidelines in the course resources if you\'d like to read more about it. This specialization consists of four courses. Each course features four modules with the first three focused on content and initial parts of the capstone project and the fourth to complete the rest of the capstone project. The capstone projects will give you the opportunity to apply the knowledge that you learn in each course to a real functional software product. In the first course, you will learn about object-oriented design. This course will build upon the basics of Java and take you to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create flexible, reusable, and maintainable software by applying object oriented design principles. You will learn how to communicate these designs by expressing them in a visual notation known as Unified Modeling Language or UML. In the first capstone project, you will be challenged to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by evolving and documenting a Java codebase with corresponding UML documentation. The second course focuses on design patterns. Design issues and applications can be resolved through design patterns commonly applied by experts. The second course extends your knowledge of object-oriented analysis and design by covering design patterns used in interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns, you will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally, you will learn how to identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells. In the second capstone project, you will be challenged to redesign an application to use design patterns. The third course covers software architecture. By the third course, you will be equipped with software design patterns and principles and will be ready to learn how architecture can be used as a basis for organizing the software systems found in industry today. Through a review of architectural styles, you will explore the structure and behavior of large scale software systems. Specific UML diagrams will express important architectural perspectives. You will learn how to analyze and evaluate a given architecture by examining the trade-offs between competing quality attributes such as modifiabilty and performance. In the capstone project in this course, you will document and evaluate the architecture of a layered Java system. Finally, in our fourth course, you will learn about service-oriented architecture. Based on the understanding of architectural styles that you learned in the third course, you will review architectures for web applications. You will then explore the basics of service-oriented architecture or SOA in two approaches, web services and representational state transfer or REST architecture. In the final capstone project, you will connect a mobile application with a variety of REST interfaces to access storage, search, and computation services. By the end of this specialization, you\'ll know how to design it right. Our courses are designed to be taken in sequential order. However, the courses do stand alone. If there was a specific area of software design and architecture that you were interested in learning about, you could just take that course. In this introductory course and throughout the specialization, we will assume that you possess basic Java programming knowledge. In this module, there is a Java pre-test that you can take to see if your Java programming skills are sufficient to succeed in the specialization. The pre-test is not meant to discourage you from taking our specialization, but is intended to set you up for success by identifying areas that you may need to review before taking this specialization. We understand that our learners will come from various backgrounds and experience levels. In order to make sure that all our learners are on the same page, we have tried to be explicit when introducing new terms. Based on your experience level, you might find that you should complete additional readings to fully grasp the topics or if you are an experienced developer, you may find that some topics you already know. In a specialization of this size, it\'s difficult to ensure the material is appropriate for everyone. We\'ve done our best to provide you with the resources you need to understand the material. We\'ve found that even if you are an experienced developer, there\'s still a lot to learn. So, we encourage you to engage with the lessons even if you\'ve covered the material before. Who knows? Maybe the material has changed since you learned it. I also encourage experienced learners to share their expertise in the discussion forums. Let\'s build a strong community of mentorship and camaraderie. Well, I think you\'re ready to embark on this journey. So once again, welcome to the Software Design and Architecture specialization brought to you in partnership by the University of Alberta and Coursera. I hope you enjoy it and I wish you the best of luck. ', '2017-09-18'),

(85, 'What does a career in software design and architecture look like? What is the difference between software design and software architecture? These are questions that we will explore in more detail throughout the specialization. However, let\'s take a quick look at them now. Like many roles in the software industry, the software designer or a software architect role can look very different from company to company. Characteristics like company size, the scope of the project, the experience of the development team, the organizational structure and the age of the company can all impact what these roles look like. In some companies, there may be a distinct role for a software designer or architect. In other companies, the design may be completed by a member or members of the development team. Typically, the software designer role would be responsible for outlining a software solution to a specific problem by designing the details of individual components and their responsibilities. A software architect role would be responsible for looking at the entire system and choosing appropriate frameworks, data storage, solutions and determining how components interact with each other. That brings us to the primary difference between software design and software architecture. In short, software design looks at the lower level aspects of a system, whereas software architecture tends to look at the bigger picture, the higher level aspects of a system. Think of this like designing a building. An architect focuses on the major structures and services, while an interior designer focuses on the smaller spaces within. Great software designers and architects are detail-oriented, forward thinkers. They need to be able to see the product at both the low and high levels. They need to be creative problem solvers in order to come up with a quality solution for the problem at hand. And they need to be able to express these ideas effectively with the product manager and the development team. Does that sound like something you\'d be good at? Software design and architecture is essential to the software development process. Let\'s take a look at what people in the industry feel about this role. Software design is the process of turning the wishes and requirements of a customer into working code that is stable and maintainable in the long run, and can be evolved and can become part of a larger system. That\'s software design. I like the or because I don\'t make a distinction between software architecture and software design. I think they\'re just the same problem at a different scale. Way I like to think of it is that architecture is primarily, begins with understanding what\'s the business problem that the client needs to solve. Where business doesn\'t mean necessarily financial business, any business. Once you\'ve realized that that\'s your primary task, which is to figure out what the client wants, then everything kind of falls in after that. Because If you understand the problem, then you can start to think about what, in your previous experience, as possible solutions, and then you start getting a idea of how your overall solution is going to look like. And that\'s where I kind of say, really architecture is the study of boxes and lines. Because your first description of what it is you\'re trying to do is simply a set of boxes with things inside them and lines expressing relationships. Design and architecture is important if you want to have a stable, long- lived system. Anybody can build a system that\'ll last a week or a month or a year, but if you want to build something that is the basis of other people\'s work and contribution over potentially a period of years or longer, in some cases, you need to put some thought into it. You need to have somebody whose job it is to look out for the long game and make sure that you are not making suboptimal short term decisions. Architecture is important because if you get it wrong, your project will fail. That\'s it. It\'s just that simple. We know it in the building world, and we know it in the software world. Where we\'re using the term architecture to be this understanding of the relationship between the requirements of the user and the ability to build a system that will deliver those requirements. I think you can trace back most major software failures to bad architecture, where architecture is used in this general sense. One of the key challenges in software architecture is the tendency to have to trade off between speed and quality, If I boil it down, right? I think there\'s a tendency for the customer in the business to want their, their software, to want their results as soon as possible. And there\'s a tendency for the engineering team to want to build, the most robust, thoroughly designed, thoroughly implemented system possible. And so we trading off between these things all the time. And I think, it\'s that tension in that trade off is where you get really good software, you get good designs out of that, but it\'s a process you have to go through to go through that. So our biggest issue that we face is understanding the client\'s problem. What is it they really want to do? And in many cases the client actually doesn\'t know what they want to do either. They come in with only a partial understanding, a vague kind of sense that they could be doing things better. But often, one of our first task is to actually help them understand, with more precision, what their business is. A software architect\'s job is to be the interface between the product and the customer and the engineering teams. And so for instance, customers will express a requirement or a need they have of the, of the software and it\'s the architect\'s job to then work with the customers and their representatives, product managers and such, to come up with the technical requirements of how we\'re going to solve the problem. And then they take those requirements to the engineering teams and worked with the engineers on how to realize that in a way that is meeting the customer\'s requirements and also aligned with the technical best practices and nonfunctional requirements that have to be adhered to in the product. The software architect is like a building architect. They\'re responsible for the overall conceptual integrity of the project. Their main goal is to serve the needs of the customer within the budget that the customer has. I would express software design or software architecture in a couple of different ways. For small things, for simple things, you\'ll sit with an engineer and you\'ll whiteboard something out and you\'ll come up with a design that way and you\'ll basically get them going. For larger initiatives, larger projects, you\'re typically writing fairly substantial design specification documents, where you\'re exploring all the different possible use cases, all the different possible flow variations and things of this kind, in addition to all of those critical functional and nonfunctional requirements, stability, maintainability, these kinds of things. So, in general, I would say that we communicate software architecture through the written word, through wikis, through white papers, these kinds of things, in addition to fairly detailed engineering design schematics, class diagrams, if necessary, big box diagrams, if it\'s just a simple high level architecture design. I\'ve been programming for 45 years and one thing I\'ve learned is that the only thing that\'s really there is the code and everything else that you talk about is views on the code. So, I like to express architecture or describe architecture as saying that, all the things that I\'m going to do, the boxes and lines, the prose, the fancy diagrams of the diagrams and napkins, there are simply indexes into the code. That\'s how you find your way to the actual artifact that\'s actually doing what you want to do. I tend to apply simplicity first as my main principle, if I\'m looking at how I\'m approaching the problem. That\'s the filter that I try to use on it. And I often will find myself, there\'s a tendency in people to complicate things, to inject complexity because it\'s interesting. As an engineer, as a technical person, complexity is fun and interesting. And it\'s only when you stripped away all the unnecessary complexity that you realize you\'ve got the core of a great solution to a problem. And so, I really try to do that and when I\'m working with product teams and engineers alike, that simplicity principle really helps to cut through a lot of the confusion. What\'s the most important principle? Simplicity. That\'s true and it\'s the engineering maxim to keep it simple. The reason for that is twofold. One is that if it\'s simple, you probably have a pretty good chance of getting it right or almost right. That\'s one part. The other thing is if it\'s simple, then you can explain it to someone simply, that communication of architecture is important because you\'re not going to be around forever. And you need to transfer your knowledge over to someone else. And if it\'s not simple, the knowledge transfer cost is higher because it\'s more complicated to explain and the chances of misunderstanding are much higher. So, I became interested in software design by working as an engineer and being exposed to larger scale code bases, you know, progressively over the years. When I first started, of course, I worked on mostly very, very small things. And I was very interested in how software was put together and the design at, a micro design level. And then, as I proceeded in my career and I started to be exposed to some fairly large pieces of software that served millions of people, I got really interested in how those things are put together and what is it that makes that successful. And how do you make sure that you\'re not having to re-implement this thing over and over and over again. And I found that to be a really interesting side of the business that I really hadn\'t explored before. And so it turns out I really enjoyed that. I think, if you start writing code to do things, to play around, you start asking yourself questions about: well, why is it that this code is really nice to work with and this code here is horrible? And you start asking yourself questions about design and the difference between design and architecture in the software business is, there really isn\'t any because our business is all self-similar. Issues that you ask about programs are the same issues you can ask about big systems. And I think in my case, I just became interested in this fundamental understanding of the issue of building software artifacts. And then it just naturally scales up, at some point you\'re building systems with a hundred thousand lines of code. And then, you suddenly realize on your project team that you don\'t have a million lines of code. And you\'re now a software architect because you have a million lines of code whereas before you were just a programmer you only had 10,000 lines of code. Most architects that I know started as software engineers. Usually as an intern or a new grad and they work basically overtime. They work on progressively larger and larger pieces of the software that they\'re responsible for. And what happens is, you start to see those engineers get to a level of comfort where they start to push outside of the code base that they\'re indirectly responsible for. And they start involving themselves in discussions around the larger impacts to the system of the work that\'s being done. And that just generally continues until all of a sudden they\'re actually working at a much higher level of abstraction. And then contributing at a very different level and so that\'s how you know you\'ve got an architect on your hands. Yeah, there\'s not a career path into software architecture. What it really is is, if you think of architects as having more responsibility than programmers, what it really is as a career path where you get more and more responsibility, that you do by demonstrating that you\'re actually good at building things. My experience has been that I didn\'t think I was a expert programmer until I had been out in the world for 10 years and I think that\'s consistent with many of my colleagues. Over that period, you start working on bigger and bigger systems and eventually someone trusts you with being the point person to put together a design for a much larger system than you\'d ever done before. And then once you\'ve done one of those and it hasn\'t been a total disaster, you get an even bigger system. So I guess, it\'s gradual building of your reputation is what makes you into a software architect. I would say the most exciting thing about being a software architect is the satisfaction of seeing the final product put together and out there and being used by real people to good effect, right. Because you spend all this time early on in a project and you have to fight for your nonfunctional requirements and you have to fight for how this is all going to be put together. And then when it all comes together and you\'ve done all that negotiation and it\'s out there in the hands of a customer and it\'s valuable, there\'s a real sense of pride with that. I think, additionally, you also get a lot of satisfaction and pride from making the right call in terms of long term viability of a code base and of a project. And so seeing somebody be able to come to your product, maybe years later, and make some very business critical contribution extension of something that you designed, without having to redesign it, is very satisfying. It tells you that you hit it on the right mark. What\'s exciting in architecture? Well in general, you don\'t want too much excitement because that\'s usually associated with some sort of looming disaster. But what\'s interesting about software architecture, and that continues to make it interesting, is that someone always has a problem that\'s slightly different than all the problems you\'ve seen before, which means that your previous solutions aren\'t necessarily going to work and you get to do something new. So, it\'s the novelty that makes up architecture interesting. An architect has to have a number of important skills, obviously, deep technical expertise is table stakes. You have to be a technical guru, I think, at a certain level. In addition to that, you need to be able to communicate with people at the level that they want to be communicated with. So if you\'re talking to a business person, they don\'t want to hear about your code. They want to hear about their business problems. And they want to hear how you\'re solving their business problems. If you\'re talking to an engineer, they want to know the business context but they need you to talk to them about code. And so, it\'s really important to have that ability to understand how the person you\'re talking to wants to be communicated with. So empathic communication, I would say, is really important. Additionally, some basic functional skills like a little bit of project planning and organizational skills, being able to keep a backlog of work so that you don\'t forget about things. Be able to juggle a lot of different competing concerns at the same time is also a very important skill. The most important ones are what I would call, the soft people skills that you need in order to get people to tell you what their requirements are. This is very hard actually, especially in situations of uncertainty. Clients are very reluctant typically, to tell you the things that they\'re really bad at. They like to tell you all the things that they know how to do but they\'re reluctant to express where their understanding of a problem is incomplete or where their business processes just don\'t work right. And, if you don\'t identify those areas, you\'ve actually encountered a big risk in your project, because those are the areas that are the problem. The well understood parts of a client\'s needs are not an issue. It\'s the parts that are fuzzy and not well understood. But of all the technical skills that you\'ve got, you need this meta skill, which is to look at various technologies and ideas and decide, is that going to be useful to me or not in my particular problem I\'m trying to solve? So as an architect, you have to know a lot about what\'s out there. But not in a tremendous amount of detail because a lot of the stuff that\'s out there, isn\'t going to be useful to you, at least immediately. By the time you might need it, it\'s probably gone through 10 releases anyway and isn\'t the same thing. So you have to have the skill of being able to quickly assess various technologies and fit them into your understanding of the discipline. So new language comes out, you so say, \"Oh yeah, this is yet another procedural language with nothing much different than all these other ones.\" Or you might see something else and says, \"Oh, that\'s interesting. I wonder if this particular style of approaching the problem, perhaps, aspect oriented programming, just to pull something of the air, will actually help me solve my problem in a better way or express my problem in a better way.\" Well, staying up to date is a bit of a trick. It\'s about exposing yourself to as much as you can in the outside world and inside your own company, as well. But in particular, you know, look at what the big companies are doing. What\'s Apple doing? What\'s Google doing? What\'s Amazon doing? And you read their blogs. You play with their software. You get an account on whichever tool you want to use and you start using those things. And you use that for inspiration. And just to see how others are approaching architecture in their systems, right? So there\'s a number of levels of inspiration there, I think. Additionally, read a lot of just the general tech press and find out what\'s going on out there in the world. Read academic journals for the appropriate areas and see what\'s coming a little farther down the line. What are the academics thinking about? So there\'s lots of those things to go after. So the advice I would give to a new software architect is to get as comfortable talking to people as you can and meet as many people as you as humanly possible. Expose yourself to as many ideas as you can. And share your own perspective as well. And I think it\'s by by leveraging the community, leveraging those around you, that you\'re going to be inspired to be creative in your architecture and you\'re going to get a better understanding of the context in which you\'re operating, both within your business as well as the broader technology landscape out there. And it\'ll help you to make better choices, ultimately. The advice you give to new software architect is the same advice you give to a musician. Try and play with people who are much better than you are because that\'s how you become a better architect. And that means working with people who are better than you are. If you have the opportunity, at the very least, try to read as much of the foundational literature in the field and there\'s not that much to read. There\'s a maybe 20 key resources you should go to. Some of them dating back to the original papers in the 70s about coupling and cohesion. And then, of course, writing code. So you need to work with people that are better than you are. Read a lot of code and read a lot of code and that\'s how you become a software architect. Oh and of course, learning from your mistakes is also quite valuable. ', '2017-09-18'),
(87, 'Why are there so many people in the world without food, water, schools and doctors?\n\nFor people living in the rich countries talking about development usually means feeling sorry for poor people in poor countries, or feeling happy about pop stars or politicians who say they have done something to help them. But, if you look at it another way, all of the human race is developing?\n\nTwenty years ago the world was divided into three parts. The first world was the rich countries of Western Europe, North America and Japan. The Soviet Union and countries closely connected with it made another different world, and then there was the Third World ? countries which had to choose which side they were on. The Third World did not get its name for being poor but for being outside of the Cold War, or in fact the places where the Cold War could turn into a real one.\n\nThen the second world disappeared. This meant that poor countries were only left with one choice if they wanted to get richer ? doing business with everyone else on the planet. Many of the poorest countries got professional help to do this from the International Monetary Fund, The World Bank and other organisations. These organisations lent them money and told them what kind of political changes to make in their country.\n\nDuring the same period the economies of the rich countries have been changing. A lot of industries have closed down or been moved abroad, There has been a big increase in the employment of people who provide services ? complicated services like investments or insurance and simple ones like sandwiches. It\'s clearly not true that that these countries have finished developing, in fact they are changing faster and faster with every new technology and fashion.\n\nDevelopment is happening everywhere around the world and it has started to be called globalisation. There is a serious argument that this process is unfair and that it is causing a lot of poverty in poor countries and in rich ones.\n\nSome of the anti-globalists are really not interested about economics at all. However, the economic parts of the argument go something like this:International trade is good for a minority of people who receive the profits from big transactions. These rich people tend to spend or save their money in the capitals of rich countries, so they don\'t do much to help people in their own countries. The worst situation occurs in areas where there are no resources that the rest of the world wants to buy. International trade can\'t help these countries at all.\n\nThe world\'s wealth ends up going to the richest organisations in the richest countries, the banks and the big companies that are involved in international trade. It leaves the poor countries either to pay back loans, or to buy expensive luxuries, weapons and other things that only the First World produces.', '2017-12-03'),
(88, 'With World Health day on 7th April, this week we take a closer look at a very common health problem.\n\nDoes your chest regularly feel tight? Do you find it difficult to breathe after light exercise? Do you sometimes make a wheezing sound when you breathe? If so, you might be asthmatic. If you have breathing problems please consult a doctor, but even if you do have asthma - don\'t worry, you are not alone.\n\nWhat is asthma?\nAsthma is a condition that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide and more than 5 million people in the UK are asthmatic, about one in thirteen people. It is a lung disease that affects your airways ? the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs. It causes the muscles in these tubes to contract, the tubes themselves to swell and also causes sticky mucus to be produced. All of these factors can make it very difficult for a sufferer to breathe properly.\n\nShortness of breath, especially after exercise, coughing, or difficulty breathing while sleeping, are all common symptoms. These can be described as mild asthma attacks; however, they can usually be controlled by medication. A severe asthma attack, on the other hand, where a sufferer finds it very difficult to breathe, may require hospital treatment. How badly you are affected by these symptoms depends on what type of asthma you have; from mild to chronic; and how well you are able to control the disorder.\n\nWhat causes it?\nAsthma is not contagious, although it\'s still not known precisely what causes it. People can be born with it; develop it in childhood, or at any age. If you have asthma, it\'s likely that someone else in your family had it, as the illness is known to run in families. There is also some evidence that environmental factors, such as diet, housing conditions or smoking during pregnancy, can cause asthma.\n\nHaving the condition doesn\'t necessarily mean you will suffer badly from the symptoms. Mild or moderate asthma can be easily controlled through medication or lifestyle changes. Additionally, all attacks need a trigger, and if these triggers can be identified and avoided, the likelihood of an attack decreases. Triggers can include: pollution, smoking, dust, animal hair, stress, pollen, exercise, and cold air. These triggers are personal to each individual sufferer, so if you have asthma, make sure you know what is causing your attacks, you can then better avoid these triggers.\n\nHistory\nAsthma is not a recent condition, in fact there is written evidence of the condition from ancient Egyptian times. The word asthma itself was first coined by the physician Hippocrates over 3000 years ago, and was the Greek for ?difficult breathing.\' Over the years, people have tried many remedies both physical and mental, to combat the illness.\n\nTo alleviate the symptoms, people changed their diet, avoided polluted towns, or took herbal/folk cures such as tobacco smoke, owl\'s blood, chicken soup, tar fumes, or acupuncture. Blood letting and opium were also popular treatments. Prayer and meditation were used to enable people to better control their own breathing. Some of these remedies or breathing techniques are still being used today.\n\nMedicine and preventative measures\nIt wasn\'t until the mid 20th century that doctors realised asthma attacks were caused by the swelling and contraction of the airways. Consequently, in the last 40 years there have been many developments in the treatment of asthma. There are presently two main types of medicine: preventers and relievers. A preventer is used every day and reduces the swelling of the airways, cutting the risk of an attack. A reliever, such as Ventolin, is taken when breathing has become (or is going to become) difficult, this actually relaxes the muscles of the airways, reducing constriction and improving the airflow. The medicine is usually taken using an inhaler.\n\nPrevention is also good treatment, so if you have asthma, remember to keep generally healthy, take regular exercise and lots of vitamin C to avoid colds and flu ? which can be dangerous for asthma sufferers. A healthy diet is also important, and do watch what you eat, as certain foods or food additives can be asthma triggers.\n\nBy taking the right medication and making the right lifestyle choices, there is no reason why most asthma sufferers shouldn\'t be able to lead perfectly healthy and active lives.\n\nFamous sufferers\nThere have been many famous asthmatics past and present. These include:\n\nBeethoven, Che Guevera, Benjamin Disraeli, Marcel Proust, Bob Hope and Martin Scorsese\n\nThere are even asthmatic sporting heroes such as:\n\nDennis Rodman (basketball), Paul Scholes (football - Manchester United) and Paula Radcliffe (UK Long Distance runner)\n\nThe future\nUnfortunately there is still no cure for asthma, although the development of new treatments has led to a much better quality of life for most sufferers. However, the number of people being diagnosed as asthmatic has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. This increase could be due to environmental or dietary factors, but for the moment researchers are puzzled.\n\nIt is not unusual for the symptoms of asthma to diminish as sufferers get older, although personally after 27 years I\'m still waiting', '2017-12-03'),
(89, 'Can we believe what we see?\n\nDinosaur art has a long history. Life-size models in natural history museums, paintings and drawings, children\'s toys, and of course, the recent spate of computer generated films. It captures the imagination, popularises the science and raises money for museums to support more research. We love looking at dinosaurs. But what are we seeing? The real thing? Or a little fact and a lot of imagination? Did the velociraptor look like a giant lizard? Or like a snake with long legs? Or did it look more like a bird with feathers but no wings?\n\nBones\n\nAll dinosaur reconstruction begins with bones. The good news is that more and more fossils of different types are being discovered all over the world. The bad news is that we don\'t have complete skeletons for all the species that are being discovered. And it can be surprisingly difficult to work out where all the bones are supposed to go. One of the first reconstructions of the Iguanadon, over a hundred years ago, had a small horn on its nose. It was actually the creature\'s thumb. Nowadays, we have multiple examples of complete sets of bones for some species, but that doesn\'t mean that everyone agrees about their skeletal structure. Scientists are still arguing about whether the triceratops family had straight legs like a rhinoceros or bent legs like a lizard. And you\'ll see both versions in dinosaur art. There are things that bones don\'t tell us.\n\nMuscles\n\nThe next step is to put muscles onto the skeleton. Muscles make marks on the bones that they are connected to, so we can study these marks in existing animals and draw conclusions about dinosaurs. But there are large parts of bodies without any bones - the whole abdominal area for example. How much muscle is there? A lot, like a horse? Or a little like a bird? Computer modelling can help with this problem, but not everyone reaches the same conclusions. A computer model has been produced that shows that Tyrannosaurus Rex didn\'t have big enough leg muscles to run very fast. And scientists are still arguing about it. There\'s other evidence to show that he could run very fast indeed.\n\nSoft tissue\n\nWho could guess from its skeleton that an elephant has enormous ears and a long trunk? Soft tissue doesn\'t fossilise. Some imprints of dinosaurs\' soft tissue have been found in rock possibly showing humps, or frills on the back of the creature or on the top of its head, but not in much detail. There really isn\'t enough evidence for a lot of the additional features that we see in our favourite images of some dinosaur species. Scientists are studying soft tissue to try to find out what organs dinosaurs had and what they used them for. If you examine an elephant\'s skull, you\'ll find evidence that it has a long trunk - spaces for passages for blood and nerves and tiny muscle connections for example. This research will be able to give us a lot of information about dinosaurs\' outward appearance.\n\nSkin\n\nSome preserved imprints of dinosaur skin show reptile-like scales, but it isn\'t clear if they covered the whole body. Dinosaur fossils with feathers have been found in China and more and more scientists are now accepting that many dinosaurs, including T Rex, probably had primitive feathers as a way of keeping warm. And maybe primitive fur. That\'s certainly a revolution in the traditional depiction of dinosaurs. The colour of the skin, or scales, or feathers or fur, is another problem. There is no evidence at all from the fossils. The colours that are traditionally used are based on what we know of the animal\'s natural habitat and whether it needed to hide for protection. But we could be completely wrong. We don\'t even know how well dinosaurs could see colour. Most of the assumptions are based on what we know about birds and reptiles today.\n\nFaces\n\nWe don\'t know the shape of dinosaur eyes. Were they thin and slit-like, like reptiles? Or round, like birds? In traditional dinosaur art, the dangerous, predatory dinosaurs often have slit-like eyes because it makes them look nastier. The gentle vegetarians are given soft, round eyes. And what about nostrils? Traditionally, dinosaur nostrils have been placed quite high on their heads. But it\'s now believed that they were much lower down, closer to the mouth. This discovery has a lot of implications for how the animals lived and breathed. It\'s a big change for the artists to consider too.\n\nSo what\'s the conclusion?\n\nA 77 million-year-old mummified dinosaur (Brachylophosaurus) was found recently, and scientists are hoping that he (or she) will answer a lot of questions, particularly about skin, scales, muscles and soft tissue in general. Only a handful have ever been found before and this is the first one that can be studied in detail with modern technology.\n\nUntil then, the fact remains that a lot of very different looking dinosaurs can be drawn from the same basic scientific evidence. And I think that the dinosaur-loving public should get to see all of them.', '2017-12-03'),
(90, 'Rice is low-fat and high in energy, and you can mix it with just about anything to make a wide variety of tasty nutritious dishes. Ask anyone from any country in the world to tell you their favourite rice recipe and you will get a wide selection, ranging from sushi in Japan to risottos in northern Italy.\n\nRice is closely connected to the culture of many societies. Hindu and Buddhist religions use rice as a religious offering. Burmese folklore uses rice as a central part of their creation story; the gods gave the first people of Burma rice seeds and directed them to Burma, where the rice would grow well. A Chinese proverb says that ?precious things are not pearls and jade but the five grains, of which rice is the finest.? Chinese myth tells how, after severe floods, there was nothing to eat and the people were starving. One day they saw a dog coming across the fields, and hanging onto the dog?s tail were bunches of long yellow seeds. The seeds grew into rice and the people survived.\n\nThe origins of rice are uncertain, because rice has been grown for so many thousands of years. In several Asian languages, the words for food and rice, or for rice and agriculture, are the same, one of the facts that points to Asia as the origin of rice. It is certain, however, that rice cultivation is one of the most important developments in history, for rice has fed more people over a longer period of time than any other crop.\n\nThe demand for rice is growing steadily, with consumption stretching beyond the traditional rice growing areas in Asia. You can find rice fields in Europe, Latin America and Australia. However, Asia is still the biggest rice producer, accounting for 90% of the world?s production and consumption of rice.\n\nRice is a staple food for many countries. In parts of Africa and Asia, many poorer urban families get over half their daily calories from rice. As the world population increases, can rice keep up? To meet growing demands, rice production has to be raised by at least 70% over the next three decades. The area devoted to rice cultivation cannot grow, so much international research is being done to find ways of growing rice on less land.\n\nRice needs a good water supply to grow. Water is wasted daily all over the world and estimates suggest that most Asian countries will have severe water problems by 2025. It takes 5000 litres of water to grow a kilo of rice, yet many rice growing areas in Asia and Africa are drought-prone. Scientists need to develop varieties of rice that can withstand sudden heavy rains and compete with weeds.\n\nWorryingly, rice production is affected by global climate changes. Global warming is caused by toxic gas emissions in developed countries. The rise in global temperature cuts rice-growing time, and ultra violet light radiation from the sun reduces tolerance to disease. Methane gas, one of the culprits of global warming, is, ironically, a by-product of wet lowland rice cultivation. Methane-producing bacteria thrive in wet rice fields and the plants themselves send the gas into the atmosphere. Water management could reduce methane emissions, but practical methods that do not reduce rice yields still have to be found.', '2017-12-04');
